                <p>Draw The Future Foundation works as a conduit to bring the best learning principals sourced from
                    educators and thinkers around the world to children in emerging countries. </p>

                <h2>What we do?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create simple high quality educational programs</li>
                    <li>Create benchmarks</li>
                    <li>Ensure Developmentally and cultural appropriateness</li>
                    <li>Solve logistics of deployment in the field</li>
                    <li>Work with partner organization to deploy</li>
                    <li>Measure and monitor quality and accountability</li>
                </ul>
                <h2><span style="">Why is this needed?</span><span style=""> </span></h2>

                <p>Reading a book with a child without engaging him or her in conversation is great but what really
                    helps them to develop literacy skills is engaging them in “dialogic reading”. Asking the kid what is
                    groining to happen next? Or why something happened? Engages the kids to reason and to develop
                    vocabulary and communications skills in addition to the basic reading skills.</p>

                <p>Draw the Future programs create “Structured learning opportunity” where in a playful setting the kids
                    learn to reason, communicate and are encouraged to dream of something big to achieve.</p>

                <p></p>

                <h2>Our Classes:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Drawing Basics</li>
                    <li>Draw Your Future Job</li>
                </ol>

                <p>There are lots of educational programs and materials that are effective in a western world settings however they would be impractical for use in a poor developing country school.</p>
                <p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>
                <h3>Some of the barriers in these schools:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Under paid or non paid teachers</li>
                    <li>Lack of any Teacher education and training</li>
                    <li>Sever lack of funds and books, note pads, color pencils, maps and any teaching aids</li>
                    <li>Lack of experimentation</li>
                </ul>
                <p> </p>
                <h3>What is proven to make a difference in many studies such as the Perry Project, or Reggio Emilia curriculum?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Having children in safe protected environment</li>
                    <li>Have very rich learning</li>
                    <li>They can explore and play</li>
                    <li>With adults that are deeply invested in them who care about them and guide them and give them more data and evidence about the world</li>
                </ul>
