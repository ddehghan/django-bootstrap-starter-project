                        learning principals sourced from
                        educators and thinkers around the world to children in emerging countries.

                <h2>Why is this needed?</h2>

                <p>Reading a book with a child without engaging him or her in conversation is great but what really
                    helps them to develop literacy skills is engaging them in “dialogic reading”. Asking the kid what is
                    going to happen next? Or why something happened? Engages the kids to reason and to develop
                    vocabulary and communications skills in addition to the basic reading skills.</p>

                <p>Draw the Future programs create “Structured learning opportunity” where in a playful setting the kids
                    learn to reason, communicate and are encouraged to dream of something big to achieve.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>What we do?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create simple high quality educational programs</li>
                    <li>Create benchmarks</li>
                    <li>Ensure Developmentally and cultural appropriateness</li>
                    <li>Solve logistics of deployment in the field</li>
                    <li>Work with partner organization to deploy</li>
                    <li>Measure and monitor quality and accountability</li>

                <h2>Testing in the filed</h2>

                <p>There are lots of educational programs and materials that are effective in a western world settings
                    however they would be impractical for use in a poor developing country school.</p>

                <h2>Evidence Based Programs</h2>
                There are numerous scientifically proven early childhood educational programs that we study and take
