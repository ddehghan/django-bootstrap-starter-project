            <h2>Our Mission</h2>

            <p>Education is the key that empowers a child to reach his or her own dreams and potential, yet millions
                of children around the world do not have access to basic educational resources.</p>

            <p>Draw The Future Foundation helps to fill that gap by creating effective educational programs that
                nurture kids creativity and encourage them to dream big. </p>

            <p>In many developing counties schools are a dry and rigid place where children are forced to memorize
                and recite blindly. We aim to change that by helping kids have fun while learning.</p>

            <p>The first project along this journey is to bring fun, creativity and empowerment to children through
                drawing. We provided drawing supplies and ask the kids to draw a picture of their family or their
                future job. With the help of volunteers and local teachers we nudge the kids to envision a better
                life for themselves and their family and increase their desire to stay in school and lean.</p>
