                <h2>Our Mission</h2>

                <p>Education is the means that empowers children to realize their own dreams and potential. However,
                millions of children around the world lack basic educational resources.</p>

                <p>Draw The Future Foundation helps fill that gap by creating effective, educational programs that nurture
                childrenâ€™s creativity and encourage them to dream big.</p>

                <p>In many developing counties schools are a dry and rigid place where children are forced to memorize
                    and recite blindly. We aim to change that by helping kids have fun while learning.</p>

                <p>The first project along this journey is to bring fun, creativity and empowerment to children through
                    drawing. We provided drawing supplies and ask the kids to draw a picture of their family or their
                    future job. With the help of volunteers and local teachers we nudge the kids to envision a better
                    life for themselves and their family and increase their desire to stay in school and lean.</p>
